## **Whiteboard Image Documentation**

### **1. Problem Domain**
- **Description**: Provide a brief overview of the problem you are addressing. Describe the context and why it is important. For example, if you're working on a stack data structure with a delete middle method, explain why removing the middle element is a useful or interesting operation.
- **Example**: Implementing a stack with the ability to remove the middle element is useful in scenarios where you need to manage dynamic data structures and efficiently handle operations on them.

### **2. Inputs and Expected Outputs**
- **Inputs**: List the possible inputs to your function or algorithm. Include types and constraints. For example, for a stack operation:
  - **Input**: A stack with `n` elements, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- **Expected Outputs**: Describe what the output should be based on the given inputs. For example:
  - **Output**: A stack with the middle element removed. If the stack size is odd, the exact middle element is removed. If even, the lower middle element is removed.

### **3. Edge Cases**
- **Description**: Identify and describe any edge cases that your algorithm or function should handle. Examples include:
  - **Empty Stack**: What happens if the stack is empty?
  - **Single Element**: What if there is only one element in the stack?
  - **Two Elements**: How does the algorithm behave with two elements?

### **4. Visual**
  - **Initial Stack**: Top -> 7 -> 14 -> 3 -> 8 -> 5 -> End
  - **After Removing Middle**: Top -> 5 -> 8 -> 14 -> 7 -> End

### **5. Algorithm**
- **Steps**: Provide a step-by-step description of the algorithm used to solve the problem. For example:
  1. **Calculate Middle Index**: Determine the index of the middle element.
  2. **Move Elements**: Transfer elements to a temporary stack until the middle element is reached.
  3. **Remove Middle**: Pop the middle element.
  4. **Restore Elements**: Transfer elements back from the temporary stack to the original stack.

### **7. Big O Time/Space Complexity**
- **Time Complexity**: Analyze the time complexity of your algorithm. For example:
  - **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the stack. This is because you may need to move all elements to the temporary stack and then back.
- **Space Complexity**: Analyze the space complexity of your algorithm. For example:
  - **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the additional space used by the temporary stack.
