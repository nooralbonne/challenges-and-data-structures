### 1. Problem Domain

**Problem Domain:** Implement a method to reverse a stack using a queue in C#. The method should transfer elements from the stack to a queue and then transfer them back to the stack in reversed order.

### 2. Inputs and Expected Outputs

**Inputs:**  A `StackWithReverse` instance that has elements pushed onto it.

**Expected Outputs:** After calling `ReverseStack()` on the stack, the order of the elements should be reversed.

**Example:**

```csharp
StackWithReverse stack = new StackWithReverse();
stack.Push(1);
stack.Push(2);
stack.Push(3);
stack.Push(4);
stack.Push(5);

Console.WriteLine(stack); // Stack: Top -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
stack.ReverseStack();
Console.WriteLine(stack); // Stack: Top -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5

stack.Push(6);
stack.Push(7);
Console.WriteLine(stack); // Stack: Top -> 7 -> 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
stack.ReverseStack();
Console.WriteLine(stack); // Stack: Top -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7
```

### 3. Edge Cases

- **Empty Stack:** If the stack is empty, `ReverseStack()` should handle it gracefully and leave it unchanged.
- **Single Element Stack:** If the stack contains only one element, reversing it should result in the same stack.
- **Large Number of Elements:** Ensure that the solution works efficiently with a large number of elements.

### 4. Visual

A visual representation of the stack and queue operations:

1. **Initial Stack:** `Top -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`
2. **After Enqueuing into Queue:**
   - Queue: `Front -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`
   - Stack: Empty
3. **After Dequeuing from Queue and Pushing Back to Stack:**
   - Stack: `Top -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`
   - Queue: Empty

### 5. Algorithm

1. **Transfer Elements from Stack to Queue:**
   - Pop elements from the stack one by one.
   - Enqueue each popped element into the queue.
   - Continue until the stack is empty.

2. **Transfer Elements from Queue to Stack:**
   - Dequeue elements from the queue one by one.
   - Push each dequeued element into the stack.
   - Continue until the queue is empty.

### 7. Big O Time/Space Complexity

**Time Complexity:**

- **Push/Pop Operations:** \(O(1)\) each.
- **Enqueue/Dequeue Operations:** \(O(1)\) each.
- **ReverseStack Method:** Each element is moved from stack to queue and back, leading to \(O(n)\) time complexity, where \(n\) is the number of elements in the stack.

**Space Complexity:**

- **Stack:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of elements.
- **Queue:** \(O(n)\) for holding the elements temporarily.
- **Overall:** \(O(n)\) space complexity due to the additional space used by the queue.
